### 3. First Use

Just run the `ai` command and it will guide you through setting up your API key:

```bash
ai list all pdf files
```

You'll be prompted to:

1. Enter your API key
2. Choose to save it permanently or just for this session

That's it! No manual configuration needed.

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Standard usage
ai <description of what you want to do>

# Auto-run without confirmation
ai -y <description>

# Pretty colored output
ai --pretty <description>

# Show help
ai --help
```

The basic `ai` tool will:

1. Generate the command using AI
2. Show you the command
3. Ask if you want to execute it (unless using `-y` flag)

### 📜 Command History

Track and review all commands you've generated:

```bash
# View all history
ai-history

# View last 10 commands
ai-history -n 10

# Clear history
ai-history --clear
```

### 📝 Script Generation

Generate complete, production-ready shell scripts:

```bash
ai-script <description>

# Example
ai-script backup home directory daily
ai-script monitor system resources and send email alerts
ai-script batch convert images to webp format
```

The generated script will include:

- Shebang and proper structure
- Error handling
- Comments and documentation
- Best practices

### 🔍 Command Explanation

Understand what a command does before running it:

```bash
ai-explain "<command>"

# Examples
ai-explain "rm -rf /var/log/*"
ai-explain "find . -type f -name '*.log' -mtime +30 -delete"
ai-explain "curl -X POST https://api.example.com/data"
```

Returns:

- What the command does
- Explanation of each part/flag
- Potential risks and warnings
- Example output

### 🎯 Multiple Command Options

Get 3 different ways to accomplish the same task:

```bash
ai-multi <description>

# Example
ai-multi list large files
ai-multi find duplicate files
ai-multi monitor disk usage
```

Choose which variant to execute interactively.

### 🤖 Model Management

Switch between different Gemini models for speed vs. capability:

```bash
# Show current model
ai-model

# List available models
ai-model ls

# Switch model
ai-model gemini-2.5-pro
ai-model gemini-2.5-flash
```

Available models:

- `gemini-2.5-flash` (default) - Best price-performance, ideal for large scale processing and agentic tasks
- `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` - Fastest model optimized for cost-efficiency and high throughput
- `gemini-2.5-pro` - Advanced thinking model for complex reasoning in code, math, and STEM
- `gemini-2.0-flash` - Second generation workhorse with 1M token context window
- `gemini-2.0-flash-lite` - Second generation fast model with 1M token context window

### 📊 API Usage Check

Monitor your API key status and rate limits:

```bash
ai-usage
```

This command will:

- Check if your API key is valid and active
- Display current rate limits for your tier
- Show which model you're currently using
- Provide helpful information if you've hit rate limits
- Give tips on managing API quota

Perfect for:

- Checking why requests are failing
- Monitoring before bulk operations
- Understanding your current API limits

### Management Commands

```bash
ai-change            # Change your API key
ai-usage             # Check API usage and rate limits
ai-reload            # Reload local script
